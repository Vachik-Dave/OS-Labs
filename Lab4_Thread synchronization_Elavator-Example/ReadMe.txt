Here, I have provided tqo versions:

Elavator.c - is basic version implementations.
Improved_Elavator.c - is improved version implementation

Improved_Elavator.c :

This code is basically have few limitations:
1- one limitation that, as soon as one elvator started moveing for targeted person, that person will never been served by any other elevator.
2- As, we dont have control over threads signalling sequence, the person is not necessarily been served by nearest elevator.
